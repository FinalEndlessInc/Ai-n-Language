                <h2>Difficulties in language learning</h2>
                <p>
                    Learning a new language can be difficult. Especially when traditional methods of teaching have limitations that make it harder for students to succeed. Textbooks, videos, and audio recordings include useful content but lack personalization. Occasionally, this may result in students progressing to the next level before they thoroughly understand the material. 
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Millions of people worldwide strive to learn a new language, but very few of them end up speaking it fluently. The reasons that people give up learning languages mid-way are several, but here are the most common ones:
                </p><br>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        
                       <p><b>Lack of motivation:</b>After a couple of lessons, many people feel like they've bitten off more than they can chew, and it's not as much fun as they imagined it to be. As the topics and exercises increase in difficulty, people struggle to keep up and eventually drop out of the program.
                       </p> 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p><b>Language barrier:</b> Most students are afraid of making mistakes while speaking, while the best way to improve is by learning from them. The inability to communicate with natives of a particular language makes it difficult to practice what they've learned.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>Not focusing on grammar:</b>  While it's true that knowing basic tenses can help you converse more or less easily, you can face challenges in some situations when you don't have the necessary grammar knowledge. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul><br><br>
                <h2>How can AI help?</h2>
                <p>
                    Just as the rise of online learning revolutionized the language learning process, developments in AI technology promise a new turning point. Language learning with AI is becoming increasingly common, as AI enables various useful features in apps and programs.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <h3>Language bots</h3>
                <p>
                    Many believe that to fully understand the peculiarities of a language, you must engage with native speakers. However, AI models replicate real speech and conversations with rapidly increasing accuracy. A language learning chatbot can respond to messages with personalized, relevant information. Language learners can use a chatbot to practice conversations without the anxiety they may feel when talking to a person.
                </p><br>
                <h3>Machine translation</h3>
                <p>
                    AI technologies such as neural machine translation improve the quality of translations and help with learning foreign languages. One method known as machine translation as a bad model helps students find and fix mistakes in the machine-translated text. Ultimately, this allows students to learn more about the language and improve comprehension, writing, and vocabulary.
                </p><br>
                <h3>Personalized textbooks</h3>
                <p>
                    Personalized textbooks adapt to learners' needs based on individual progress. Textbook customization is of great value to teachers. Teachers can upload content into an AI system, which can then generate textbooks tailored to a specific school, course, or group of students. 
                </p><br><br>


                <h2>Application of AI in language learning apps</h2>

                <h3><b>Duolingo</b></h3><br>
                <p>
                    Duolingo is the most popular online language learning app in the world and has more than 300 million active users. It offers more than 100 courses in 38 languages and heavily relies on AI to deliver its personalized courses.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Duolingo has AI chatbots that you can text with to improve your skills. The algorithm is trained to understand the context and provide learners with real-time answers.

                <h2>Benefits from AI in language learning</h2>
                <p>AI algorithms have the potential to advance eLearning in every field. Companies can use language learning solutions to train employees. Individual learners can use AI in language learning to study anytime, anywhere. Schools and colleges can employ it to increase students' opportunities. More importantly, AI has already proven its significance in linguistics.</p><br>

                <h3>Adapting to student needs</h3>
                <p>
                    A key benefit of AI is the personalization of the learning experience. When teaching a class full of students, it's almost impossible for teachers to find an approach that suits all. When using AI for learning a new language, the needs of each individual student can be fulfilled. Educators can collect useful data about learners, their abilities, and their learning styles. When analyzed correctly, this data can predict future performance and pave the way for personalized education.
                </p><br>

                <h3>Providing instant feedback</h3>
                <p>
                    With artificial intelligence in language learning, feedback is almost instantaneous. AI-based platforms grade tests and evaluate essays automatically after submission, pointing out errors and how to fix them. As a result, students can instantly take action to correct their mistakes and avoid them in the future. 
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    AI language learning solutions also help teachers pinpoint weaknesses in curriculum. They can identify misleading questions, show how they can be improved, and identify who needs additional guidance.
                </p><br>

                <h3>Redifined roles for teachers</h3>
                <p>
                    Not even the most sophisticated language learning bot can entirely replace human teachers. However, AI can redefine teachers' roles. AI algorithms can carry out grading, paperwork, and other mundane administrative tasks quickly and efficiently, allowing teachers more time to coordinate learning processes and mentor students. Tech-savvy teachers may also analyze data collected by algorithms.
                </p><br>

                <h2>In conclusion...</h2>
                <p>AI keeps evolving for either the better or the bad. In this case, AI can be a helpful tool to make learning much more easier and dynamic than the traditional way. Don't worry, teachers won't loose their jobs, but they can serve as mentors for those who require an extra help.</p><br>
                <p>Maybe some people don't find using AI an efficient way to learn and still rather stick to the old learning method, everyone is different afterall, this AI technology is still available and keeps improving for the better.</p>
